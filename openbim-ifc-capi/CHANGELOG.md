# Changelog -- openbim-ifc-capi

All notable changes to the `openbim-ifc-capi` crate are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this crate follows Semantic Versioning independently of its siblings:
a release here does not imply a release of any other crate in the family.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Opt-in `mimalloc` feature (off by default): the library's Rust
  allocations go through mimalloc; the host's `malloc` is untouched.
  Reading STEP takes 23-36% fewer CPU cycles on seven real IFC files, at
  2-28% more resident memory. mimalloc is C code, so it stays opt-in; #49
  tracks a pure-Rust replacement.

- Versioned C ABI 0.1 over the IFC facade (#38, ADR 0013), following
  Axiolid's C ABI conventions: `openbim_ifc_v0_1_*` symbols, opaque integer
  handles, caller-owned buffers with a size query, no Rust allocation across
  the boundary, and every panic contained as a status.
- Nested attribute values cross as a pre-order node tape plus one string
  buffer, keeping `$`/`*`, `.U.`/`.F.`, integer/real and typed wrappers
  distinct.
- A cbindgen-generated C11 header (`include/openbim_ifc.h`), checked for
  drift, and a C and C++ smoke test in the gate.
