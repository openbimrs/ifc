# 0012 — The scalar reference is a real crate, not a doctrine

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-19
- **Deciders:** Friedrich, nehirde
- **Supersedes:** the backend topology and oracle-ownership parts of 0002

## Context

R10 says the scalar backend is the reference implementation, replay mechanism,
debugging path, and portability baseline -- not disposable scaffolding.

ADR 0002 already asserts that doctrine: *"`geom-cpu` is the correctness oracle:
portable, no intrinsics, always available."* The doctrine is right. The topology
it describes is stale and the ownership is unassigned.

Measured against the tree at the time of writing:

- `geom-cpu`, `geom-simd`, `geom-gpu`, `geom-dispatch` do not exist. The crates
  are `geom-backend-cpu` and `geom-backend-gpu`.
- Every path in ADR 0002's "Relation to existing code" is dead.
- `geom-backend-cpu` is an execution *context*: ISA detection, a Rayon pool, a
  builder. Its own docs say it "bundles no SIMD algorithm" -- and it bundles no
  scalar algorithm either.

The named oracle therefore owns no algorithm, and nothing is validated against
anything. If an optimized path lands before a scalar reference exists, both R3
(differential testability) and R10 become unenforceable, quietly.

## Decision

The scalar reference is a **named crate that owns algorithms**, distinct from
the execution context that schedules them.

- `geom-backend-cpu` stays what it is: an execution *context* (ISA detection,
  worker pool, policy). It is not the oracle and must not be called one.
- The scalar reference implementation gets its own crate, `geom-scalar`, which
  owns portable algorithms with no intrinsics, no `unsafe`, and no threading.
  It is the oracle, the replay path, and the portability baseline.
- Ordering is inverted from ADR 0002's implied schedule: **the scalar
  implementation of an operation lands before any optimized implementation of
  that operation.** An optimized path without a scalar counterpart cannot be
  differentially tested, so it does not ship.
- The oracle is never feature-gated off. Any build that can run an operation can
  also run its reference.

ADR 0002's *reasoning* (runtime selection over compile-time `#[cfg]`, single
portable binary, differential validation) stands unchanged. Only its crate
topology and its oracle assignment are superseded.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| Keep the oracle inside `geom-backend-cpu` | Conflates scheduling policy with algorithm ownership. The context crate would then need `parallel`/`simd` features on the very code that must stay portable and single-threaded to be a trustworthy reference. |
| Treat the scalar path as a fallback that may be dropped later | Exactly the "disposable scaffolding" R10 forbids. Once dropped, no optimized path can be validated and no bug can be replayed portably. |
| Rewrite ADR 0002 in place | ADRs are a decision log. Editing history hides that the topology changed and why. |
| Leave it as doctrine until algorithms exist | The gap is invisible precisely while there are no algorithms, which is when the ordering rule needs to be established. |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Every optimized path has a named, always-present counterpart to be tested
  against, so R3 and R10 are enforceable rather than aspirational.
- A portable replay path exists for debugging a SIMD or GPU discrepancy.
- The scalar crate has no features, no threads, and no intrinsics, so it is
  trivially portable to AArch64, WASM, and any future target.

**Negative / costs**

- Every operation is written at least twice. This cost was already accepted in
  ADR 0002 and is restated here, not introduced.
- One more crate in the workspace.

**Follow-ups / risks to watch**

- `geom-scalar` does not exist yet. This ADR sets the rule that governs its
  creation; it must be created with the first geometry algorithm, not after.
- The risk this ADR exists to prevent: an AVX-512 or GPU path landing first
  because it is more interesting to write. The ordering rule above is the guard.

## Relation to existing code

- `packages/geometry/geom-backend-cpu/` -- execution context; explicitly not the
  oracle.
- `packages/geometry/geom-kernel/src/capability.rs` -- `ExecutionTarget::PortableCpu`
  is the target a reference implementation reports.
- `docs/adr/0002-hardware-abstraction-and-backend-selection.md` -- reasoning
  retained, topology and oracle ownership superseded here.
