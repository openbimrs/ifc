# geom-compile instructions

Purpose: the scalar reference `GeometryCompiler`. Turns `GeometryGraph` nodes
into `TriMesh`: profile flattening, triangulation, linear extrusion, transform
composition, and boolean dispatch.

## Invariants

Extrusion output must be **closed, edge-manifold, and outward-oriented**,
because that is exactly `geom-boolmesh`'s input precondition. Volume alone does
NOT verify this: a cap lying in the z = 0 plane contributes nothing to the
divergence integral, so a flipped bottom cap is invisible to a volume check.
Use the directed-edge parity gate in `tests/extrusion.rs` — every directed edge
exactly once, every edge with exactly one opposing half-edge.

Unsupported profile and solid families return `GeomError::Unsupported`, never a
silent approximation. A missing wall is cheap; a wrong wall corrupts every
downstream quantity.

No default tolerance or chord budget. The caller supplies both, because
acceptable error depends on source units and downstream use.

## Adopted dependencies

`earcut` (ADR 0015) is named in `src/profile.rs` and nowhere else, and is not
re-exported. `geom_scalar::triangulate_simple` audits it differentially on
hole-free polygons (`tests/oracle.rs`) — the adopted crate is verified, not
trusted.

## Layer

L3, an implementation crate alongside `geom-backend-cpu` and `geom-boolmesh`.
It may depend on representation and contract crates; nothing in L0–L2 may
depend on it.
