# geom-backend-cpu implementation plan

Status: architecture scaffold; algorithms incomplete. This is planning context,
not standing agent instruction.

## Established

- Crate boundary and dependency direction are executable in the layering gate.
- Public data/contracts compile. Behavior remains scaffold unless a test names it.

## Next implementation wave

Implement a portable scalar operation provider that composes `CpuExecution`, then
mutation/differential tests, then measured SIMD and parallel provider paths.

## Exit evidence

Targeted tests, feature-isolated compile where applicable, mutation-verified
architecture/validation gates, and benchmarks before performance claims.
