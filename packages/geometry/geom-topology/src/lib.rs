//! Exact B-rep topology with typed handles and caller-owned geometry links.
//!
//! The topology graph is independent of any curve/surface implementation. A
//! model can use its own handle type as `BRep<G>`, which makes this crate usable
//! by exact kernels, mesh converters, and foreign format adapters alike.
