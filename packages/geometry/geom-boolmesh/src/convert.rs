//! `TriMesh` <-> `boolmesh::Manifold` conversion.
//!
//! Orientation is the dangerous part. An inside-out solid is structurally
//! valid: every edge still has exactly two incident faces, so a manifold check
//! passes. `boolmesh` then treats it as a solid whose interior is everywhere
//! outside, and `Difference` behaves like `Union` -- returning a larger mesh,
//! with no error and a plausible-looking triangle count.
//!
//! This was not hypothetical: the ADR 0014 evaluation harness hit exactly this,
//! and the wall's volume *grew* from 2.40 to 2.86 after subtracting three
//! openings. The failure is dangerous precisely because it is quiet.
//!
//! So orientation is checked here, on the way in, using the divergence theorem.
