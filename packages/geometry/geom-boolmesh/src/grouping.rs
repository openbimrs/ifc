//! Disjoint-cutter grouping for `subtract_many`.
//!
//! The sequential default subtracts tools one at a time, so the subject is
//! rebuilt on every step: N booleans against a mesh that keeps growing. The
//! observation that makes batching possible is that
//!
//! ```text
//! (S \ A) \ B  ==  S \ (A union B)
//! ```
//!
//! and when `A` and `B` are disjoint, `A union B` is just their concatenation
//! -- no boolean needed to build it. So a set of mutually disjoint cutters can
//! be fused into ONE tool mesh and removed with a single boolean.
//!
//! Grouping is therefore a graph-colouring problem on the overlap graph:
//! partition the tools into as few groups as possible such that no two tools
//! in a group overlap. Optimal colouring is NP-hard, so a greedy first-fit is
//! used; the result only needs to be good, not optimal, and any partition is
//! CORRECT because each group is verified disjoint before fusing.
