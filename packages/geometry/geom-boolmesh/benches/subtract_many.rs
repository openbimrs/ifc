//! `subtract_many` throughput against the ADR 0014 sequential baseline.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo bench -p geom-boolmesh`
//!
//! The question this answers is whether the batch override earns its
//! complexity. ADR 0014 recorded the sequential loop at n=16: 6.95 ms and
//! n=64: 48.68 ms. The `sequential` column reproduces that baseline in the
//! same process, so the speedup is a ratio of two measurements taken on the
//! same machine in the same run rather than against a remembered figure.
