# geom-boolmesh plan

Owner: geometry
Depends on: geom-kernel, geom-mesh, geom-core

## Done

- [x] TriMesh <-> Manifold conversion with an orientation gate on input.
- [x] `MeshBoolean` for union/intersection/difference.
- [x] Volume-conservation and winding gates; fixture issue_2019 regression.
- [x] Registry integration, including budget refusal.

## Next

- [ ] Override `subtract_many` to union disjoint cutters before subtracting, and
      prove it beats the sequential baseline recorded in ADR 0014
      (n=16: 6.95 ms, n=64: 48.68 ms). If it does not beat it, do not keep it.
- [ ] Fixture issue_1155 (near-degenerate halfspace) as a regression here once
      halfspace bounding lives in geom-model rather than the test.
- [ ] Differential test against `geom-scalar` predicates once orient3d exists.
