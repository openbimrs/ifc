//! The ADR 0003 fixture case, as an executable regression.
//!
//! `test/fixtures/ifclite-geometry/issue_2019_wall_two_overlapping_openings.ifc`
//! is a 4x0.2x3 wall with three MUTUALLY OVERLAPPING openings, two rotated off
//! the wall's axes so the overlap regions are not grid-aligned. The dimensions
//! below are transcribed from that file.
//!
//! The mesh-level geometry is asserted here rather than through the IFC lowerer
//! so this gate stays meaningful before the parser path is wired up.
