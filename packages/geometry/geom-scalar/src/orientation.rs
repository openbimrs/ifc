//! Certified orientation predicates.
//!
//! `orient2d` answers "does C lie left of, right of, or exactly on the directed
//! line AB". The answer is a *sign*, and a sign drives topology, so a plausible
//! answer is not good enough: this module returns [`Certified`] and escalates
//! to exact arithmetic rather than guessing when the filter is inconclusive.
//!
//! The strategy is the standard filtered cascade:
//!
//! 1. Evaluate the determinant in plain f64 and compute a forward error bound.
//! 2. If the magnitude exceeds the bound, the sign is proven; return it.
//! 3. Otherwise recompute exactly with error-free transformations.
//!
//! Step 1 succeeds for almost all real inputs, so the exact path is rare.
