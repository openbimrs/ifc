//! `incircle` and `insphere`: is a point inside a circumscribed ball?
//!
//! These are the Delaunay predicates. `incircle(a, b, c, d)` asks whether `d`
//! lies inside the circle through `a`, `b`, `c`; `insphere` is the 3D analogue.
//! A zero means `d` lies exactly on the ball -- the cocircular/cospherical case
//! that makes a Delaunay triangulation non-unique and, if misjudged, produces
//! inverted or overlapping cells.
//!
//! Both are lifted determinants: adding a coordinate equal to the squared
//! distance from the origin turns "inside a ball" into "below a hyperplane".
//! That lift squares the operand magnitudes, so the error bound grows faster
//! than `orient*`'s and the filter fails sooner -- which is why the escalation
//! rate is measured rather than assumed.
