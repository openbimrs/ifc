//! Arbitrary-length expansion arithmetic.
//!
//! An *expansion* is a list of non-overlapping f64 components whose exact sum
//! is the value it represents. Two f64s can hold a product exactly; a list can
//! hold an arbitrary determinant exactly. This is what lets `orient3d`,
//! `incircle`, and `insphere` certify a sign rather than guess one.
//!
//! Components are ordered smallest to largest, so the sign of a non-zero
//! expansion is the sign of its last component.
//!
//! # Cost and where it is paid
//!
//! These operations allocate. That is deliberate and confined to the *exact*
//! path, which a filtered predicate reaches only when the floating-point
//! determinant is too close to zero to trust. The benchmark harness measures
//! the escalation rate precisely so this cost is a number, not a hope.
