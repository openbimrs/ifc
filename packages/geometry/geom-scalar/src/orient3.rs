//! Positive means `d` sees `a, b, c` counter-clockwise, i.e. `d` is below the
//! plane under the right-hand rule. Zero means the four points are exactly

//! Same filtered cascade as `orient2d`: cheap f64 with an error bound, then
//! exact expansion arithmetic when the bound cannot exclude zero.
