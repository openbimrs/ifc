//! Degeneracy-controlled scene generation for benchmarking and testing.
//!
//! The question a predicate suite must answer is not "how fast is it on random
//! data" -- random points in a box are never degenerate, so that measures only
//! the filter's fast path. The useful question is how throughput and the
//! escalation rate move as the fraction of degenerate inputs rises.
//!
//! Scenes are deterministic given a seed, so a measurement is reproducible.
