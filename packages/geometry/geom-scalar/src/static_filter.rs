//! Static filters: bounds computed once from a coordinate range.
//!
//! The dynamic filter in each predicate computes a *permanent* -- a sum of
//! absolute products -- on every call, which costs roughly as much as the
//! determinant itself. When a caller can state an upper bound on coordinate
//! magnitude up front (a model's bounding box, a quantisation grid), the error
//! bound can be precomputed and the per-call work drops to one comparison.
//!
//! The trade is coverage, not correctness: a static bound is necessarily
//! looser than a per-input one, so it defers more often. It never certifies a
//! sign the dynamic filter would reject, because it is a strictly larger
//! bound. A caller that exceeds the declared range gets `None` rather than a
//! silently invalid answer.
